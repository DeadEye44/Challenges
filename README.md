# Challenge_1 Code Refactor Webpage

## Description

The goal of this code refactor was to make a codebase that more closely follows accessibility standards, so that when customers search for our products, our pages are optimized to return first in the search engine. I updated the Title and condensed the elements in the CSS file. I also changed a few of the elements to make them stand out more, and added alternate text to the links for the visually impaired.
